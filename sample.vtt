00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.980
Andreas Komninos: So, Neil, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to talk to us this morning.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.300
It's the evening for me,
but it's a little earlier in the day for you.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.580
I was wondering if you can tell
us a little bit about yourself

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.000
– where you currently work and what your UX
responsibilities and role are in your current company.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:38.160
Neil Sittler: Yeah, sure. So, I am working in Boulder, Colorado, and I work in a co-working space.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.360
I work with a software company.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.060
We make a route-finding app for professional
delivery drivers called Road Warrior.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:56.380
And we are a very small company – there's
just me and two developers, basically.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:05.040
I was just hired to sort of take care
of what we're calling "customer success".

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.780
A.K.: Excellent. So, can you tell us a little bit about your background? What did you major in? What's your training on?

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.140
N.S.: So, I studied
graphic design and illustration long ago.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.800
It was a second career. I was a cook and
a fine artist before that.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.360
But I got into graphic design.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.900
And I have been doing design for print and web for about 15 years.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.940
So, I was a very strategic
thinker as a designer,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.040
but I didn't always get to use that strategy.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.460
Creating a magazine was always my favorite project

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.380
because I'd have to
think through the pacing of the pages;

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.960
I'd have to think through content and
where it might fit strategically.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.940
I had to work with a cross-disciplinary team – the
ad sales folks, the printer,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.920
maybe some production people, hiring writers and
illustrators and art directing them

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.300
and even concepting the content. And
all of that I really loved.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.950
But once it was designed, then each issue would just
be sort of grinding out the same thing.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:36.520
And there was nothing wrong with that, but over the years I felt like there was something missing.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.480
And it wasn't until a couple of years ago that I'd even heard the term "user experience design".

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:52.800
And when I heard about it and started learning about it, it just made sense that it was something I wanted to do.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.860
A.K.: I presume that most of the training that you undertook in UX was under the IDF platform, right?

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:08.960
N.S.: That's true, yes. I would say yes, aside from just being a curious observer.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:17.280
As a graphic designer, I was never the one to just, you know, say, "I want to make a really cool rock poster"

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.780
and just kind of do that.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.780
I always one wanted to know *why*,  *who* my audience was – all of those things.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.400
So, I think I sort of was practicing some of those things and learning all through my career,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.360
but IDF sort of gave vocabulary to it and methodology.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.340
A.K.: Perfect – so, can I ask now that you are obviously successful in building your dream

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.920
and becoming an UX professional, do you still actively follow and read the IDF material?

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.780
N.S.: I do. I'm signed up for about eight classes that I intend to finish.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.240
A.K.: Okay, that's a lot of training!

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.620
N.S.: Yeah, I don't know where I'll find
the time, but I'm going to continue with

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.140
classes where I can because it's a goldmine – it's a goldmine of information.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.100
A.K.: Well, as they say, sometimes you learn more
by doing than by actual reading.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.060
So, I imagine you'll have the opportunity
there to put a lot of your skills or a

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.380
lot of the things that you kind of read
about into practice and maybe learn a

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.720
little bit more by doing things rather
than reading about them.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.199
So, I was wondering if I can ask you
if you can give us a concrete example of

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:36.000
how perhaps you may have used
knowledge from the IDF in your professional practice?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.120
N.S.: Sure – a concrete
example.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:50.260
So, over the summer I was doing some freelancing and trying to put together situations where I could practice

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.980
some of the methods I've been
learning.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:04.759
I've been sort of in charge of a youth sports
website here in Colorado for probably

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.940
about six or seven years, and I inherited
the site from somebody else.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.100
It's got really old code. I don't do a lot of
coding besides HTML and CSS.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.880
But I can make a
WordPress site from scratch.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:30.960
So, I sort of put together a project where I would
redesign this site, but with *users first*.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.000
A.K.: Okay, perfect – thank you for sharing
that.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.600
Okay, so on to my next question: what would you say is good about being a member of the IDF platform?

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.440
N.S.: I would say you learn a ton.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.280
It's great information.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.400
Your eyes are open, and you start to connect dots that you hadn't connected before.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.720
That's one thing.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.340
The study at your own pace is fantastic.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.460
The cost is
ridiculously great.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.540
You can't find an education like this anywhere for the
cost.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:19.040
But a benefit that I'm just getting into now is *community*.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.560
You know, like this interview.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.500
So, now I know you or am
getting to know you.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.780
And then, last week I had a guy from Madrid who connected with me through some of the comments

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:40.520
in one of the courses. He needed to do
a usability test on his portfolio site.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.840
And so, we had a Skype call last week
that he recorded.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.760
So, we're getting to know each other, and that's pretty cool.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:57.580
That takes a little effort – you can't just read the class material, answer the questions and then disappear.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:04.980
But if you make that effort, I find that the community is pretty willing to reciprocate.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.700
And actually, I just remembered

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:17.000
I met a woman here at a local tech meetup whom I'd seen in comments in IDF courses.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.180
So, that was pretty cool, too.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.400
A.K.: So, Neil, my final question to you – what courses would you recommend that

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.600
the beginner takes as they make the first steps in the journey towards becoming a UX professional?

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:37.340
N.S.: Sure, I've benefited a lot from Becoming a UX Designer from Scratch.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:43.463
It kind of gave me a framework of the *world of UX* and what was possible.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:46.060
So, I really like that one.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.880
And then just anything that looks
interesting – you know,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:59.280
Design Thinking I think will be a great foundation for anything you want to do in life

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.600
and for confidence.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:10.580
And the User Research class – I think that's a good overview of all the tools.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.500
And I think that's invaluable.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.040
So, I'd say start with those three.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.600
And that's coming from my background as a visual designer.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:28.540
I didn't really think about doing the user interface kind of course first.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.880
And I
will continue to pursue those.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.049
But the first thing I wanted to do was User Research – what's it all about?

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:40.919
What are the tools? How can I start
implementing those immediately?
91
00:08:40,919 --> 00:00:00,000
So, those three.
